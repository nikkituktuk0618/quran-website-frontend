            I have always been curious, constantly seeking answers to the world
            around me. As a child, I would bombard my father with endless
            questionsâ€”so many that it often left him frustrated because no one
            had all the answers to my questions. And that curiosity shaped my
            early years. My father and I used to watch automotive content, and I
            felt attracted to these machines. Liked them and I thought maybe my
            life would revolve around this passion, leading me to explore
            everything from cars, ships, and fighter jets to tanks and other
            machines that captured my interest.
