          Since the age of 15, I have been learning about Islam, though at
          first, it was out of necessity rather than devotion. The hardships in
          my life forced me to seek hope, and I found glimpses of it in Islam.
          However, I struggled with doubts. The propaganda against Islam, the
          divisions among Muslims, and my own skepticism held me back. It took
          years for my faith to solidify, and I wasn't always consistent. But
          with each hardship, I found myself turning back to Allah, finding
          comfort in the Qur'an. The more I read, the more I realized that Islam
          was not just a religionâ€”it was the ultimate guide to life.
