          Once my faith became firm, I couldn't ignore the overwhelming
          misinformation and propaganda about Islam spreading online because
          over 55% of anti-Muslim content comes from India alone in the whole
          world. The negative portrayal, the misconceptions, the cultural
          distortionsâ€”I knew I had to do something about it. That's when I
          created my Instagram page, where I could share authentic Islamic
          content and help young people clear their doubts about Islam.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8 font-poppins text-md">
          What happened next was beyond my expectations. The page grew rapidly,
          with thousands of people resonating with my content. It became clear
          that people were searching for the truth, just like I had been. They
          needed someone to guide them toward Islam in a way that was clear,
          practical, and free from cultural biases.
